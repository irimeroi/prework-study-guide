# Bootcamp Pre-work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide is a project created by a Web Development student in order to learn the basics of the three languages used in the UCLA Bootcamp before the beggining of the class. The main motivation to complete it was the need of having an understanding of how these languages work, how they can function when linked together, and what we are able to build with them. This could also be helpful to retain information faster during class. Also, this project helped to learn how to create a webpage using HTML to build the roots, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to make it interactive.

## Installation

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide is useful to learn basics concepts of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, such as their basic functions or what the acronyms stand for. It also contains suggestions on what to study first, which can be found by opening Chrome DevTools. This can be done in two different ways. You can either press the Control key + left click and open 'Inspect', or press Command + Option + I on macOs / Control + Shift + I on Windows to open a console panel with a list ot the topics learned in the prework, and the suggestion.
